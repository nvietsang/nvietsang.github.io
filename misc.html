            by Thomas Roche
            <br>
            This interesting attack shows why constant-time implementation is important in crypto.

            <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2024/08/25/telegram-is-not-really-an-encrypted-messaging-app/">Is Telegram really an encrypted messaging app?</a>
            by Matthew Green
            <br>
            This is an excellent blog about the encryption feature in Telegram. I quote my favorite paragraph: "My strong suspicion is that many people who join Telegram for its social media features also end up using it to communicate privately. And I think Telegram knows this, and tends to advertise itself as a “secure messenger” and talk about the platform's encryption features precisely because they know it makes people feel more comfortable."

            <a href="http://wiki.newae.com/Template_Attacks">Template Attacks</a>
            by NewAE Technology
            <br>
            This a gentle introduction about template attacks. It provides detailed steps of the attack concept and explains the intuition behind.

            by Frank Custers
            <br>
            This is a master thesis. I enjoyed the step-by-step explanation with a toy example about SASCA.

            <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30574-3_24">Side-Channel Leakage of Masked CMOS Gates</a>
            by Stefan Mangard, ThomasPopp and Berndt M. Gammel
            <br>
            This paper explained what glitches are and how they affect the DPA security. This is a fundamental paper leading to the invention of modern masking schemes such as Threshold Implementation. The explanations are very easy to understand.

            <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/260.pdf">Computational Aspects of Correlation Power Analysis</a>
            by Paul Bottinelli and Joppe W. Bos
            <br>
            This paper presented many approaches of computing Pearson correlation in side-channel analysis. The authors started from a naïve computation algorithm, then pointed out the limitation in terms of time and/or memory, especially when a large number of traces is used for the computation. From that, they proposed many improved versions for the computation algorithm and  thoroughly compared their efficiency.

            <a href="https://ileanabuhan.github.io/general/2021/05/07/SNR-tutorial.html">Computing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for SCA</a>
            by Ileana Buhan
            <br>
            This is an easy-to-understand introduction about the concept of SNR. The author started by explaining SNR from a statistical point of view, then linked it to the context of side-channel analysis (SCA).
