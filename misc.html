            <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/260.pdf">Computational Aspects of Correlation Power Analysis</a>
            by Paul Bottinelli and Joppe W. Bos
            <br>
            This paper presented many approaches of computing Pearson correlation in side-channel analysis. The authors started from a na√Øve computation algorithm, then pointed out the limitation in terms of time and/or memory, especially when a large number of traces is used for the computation. From that, they proposed many improved versions for the computation algorithm and  thoroughly compared their efficiency.

            <a href="https://ileanabuhan.github.io/general/2021/05/07/SNR-tutorial.html">Computing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for SCA</a>
            by Ileana Buhan
            <br>
            This is an easy-to-understand introduction about the concept of SNR. The author started by explaining SNR from a statistical point of view, then linked it to the context of side-channel analysis (SCA).
