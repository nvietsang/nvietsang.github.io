            by Matthew Green
            <br>
            This is an excellent blog about the encryption feature in Telegram. I quote my favorite paragraph: "My strong suspicion is that many people who join Telegram for its social media features also end up using it to communicate privately. And I think Telegram knows this, and tends to advertise itself as a “secure messenger” and talk about the platform's encryption features precisely because they know it makes people feel more comfortable."

            by Stefan Mangard, ThomasPopp and Berndt M. Gammel
            <br>
            This paper explained what glitches are and how they affect the DPA security. This is a fundamental paper leading to the invention of modern masking schemes such as Threshold Implementation. The explanations are very easy to understand.

            <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/260.pdf">Computational Aspects of Correlation Power Analysis</a>
            by Paul Bottinelli and Joppe W. Bos
            <br>
            This paper presented many approaches of computing Pearson correlation in side-channel analysis. The authors started from a naïve computation algorithm, then pointed out the limitation in terms of time and/or memory, especially when a large number of traces is used for the computation. From that, they proposed many improved versions for the computation algorithm and  thoroughly compared their efficiency.

            by Ileana Buhan
            <br>
            This is an easy-to-understand introduction about the concept of SNR. The author started by explaining SNR from a statistical point of view, then linked it to the context of side-channel analysis (SCA).
