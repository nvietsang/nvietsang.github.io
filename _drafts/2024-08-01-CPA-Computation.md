title: Efficient computation for CPA
---

This post summarizes efficient computation algorithms for the correlation power analysis (CPA) in [[Bottinelli and Bos, JCEN 2016]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/260.pdf). The paper employs a bottom-up approach, gradually enhancing the na√Øve algorithm. The writing is super clear.
