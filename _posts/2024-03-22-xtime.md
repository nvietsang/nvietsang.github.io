title: Field multiplication in AES implementation - xtime
---

This post explains how to implement the field multiplication taking place in the computation of MixColumns. This is important for me because I used to implement it in an ugly way when I was a student.

## # Field and polynomial
In AES, the field $$\mathbb{F}_{2^8}$$ is denoted as

$$
\mathbb{F}_{2^8} = \mathbb{F}_2[x]/(x^8 \oplus x^4 \oplus x^3 \oplus x \oplus 1).
$$

An element of this field is represented as a polynomial over $$\mathbb{F}_2$$ of degree at most $$7$$. In this representation, a byte $$\mathbf{a} = (a_7,\ldots,a_1,a_0)_2$$ corresponds to the polynomial $$a(x) = a_7x^7 \oplus \ldots \oplus a_1x \oplus a_0$$. The addition and multiplication of two polynomials is done modulo the polynomial $$x^8 \oplus x^4 \oplus x^3 \oplus x \oplus 1$$.

## # xtime function

Let $$\texttt{01}$$ and $$\texttt{02}$$ be the hexadecimal representations of two polynomials $$1$$ and $$x$$. We will show that by using the multiplications $$\texttt{01} \cdot \mathbf{a}$$ and $$\texttt{02} \cdot \mathbf{a}$$, we can compute the multiplication of $$\mathbf{a}$$ with any other byte number. First, we go into details of these two multiplications.

The first one, $$\texttt{01} \cdot \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{a}$$. Nothing to say.

The second one, $$\texttt{02} \cdot \mathbf{a}$$ is the multiplication of $$a_7x^7 \oplus \ldots \oplus a_1x \oplus a_0$$ and $$x$$. We first multiply and have the following result:

$$a_7x^8 \oplus a_6x^7 \oplus a_5x^6 \oplus a_4x^5 \oplus a_3x^4 \oplus a_2x^3 \oplus a_1x^2 \oplus a_0x.$$

We then take this polynomial and compute modulo $$x^8 \oplus x^4 \oplus x^3 \oplus x \oplus 1$$. If we do it right, we should obtain the following reminder, which is the result of our multiplication:

$$
a_6x^7 \oplus a_5x^6 \oplus a_4x^5 \oplus (a_3 \oplus a_7)x^4 \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_7)x^3 \oplus a_1x^2 \oplus (a_0 \oplus a_7)x \oplus 1
$$

For better looking, we write:

$$
\texttt{02} \cdot \mathbf{a} = (a_6, a_5, a_4, a_3 \oplus a_7, a_2 \oplus a_7, a_1, a_0 \oplus a_7, a_7)
$$

This multiplication, $$\texttt{02} \cdot \mathbf{a}$$, is usually denoted as $$\texttt{xtime}$$ function (see [the official documentation of AES](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197-upd1.pdf)). Depending on the value of $$a_7$$, we have:

$$
\texttt{xtime}(\mathbf{a}) = \texttt{02} \cdot \mathbf{a} = 
\begin{cases}
(a_6, a_5, a_4, a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0, 0) & \text{if } a_7 = 0\\
(a_6, a_5, a_4, a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0, 0) \oplus (0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1) & \text{if } a_7 = 1\\
\end{cases}
$$

## # Implementation

The implementation of $$\texttt{xtime}$$ on Python follows the above result:

```Python
xtime = lambda a: (((a << 1) ^ 0x1B) & 0xFF) if (a & 0x80) else (a << 1)
```

Another approach to implement $$\texttt{xtime}$$ (on C) is:

```C
unsigned char xtime(unsigned char x){
    return ((x << 1) ^ (((x >> 7) & 1) * 0x1b));
}
```

## # Other multiplications using xtime

For higher powers of $$x$$, such as $$x^2$$ $$(\texttt{04})$$, $$x^3$$ $$(\texttt{08})$$, $$x^4$$ $$(\texttt{10})$$, etc., we repeat the application of $$\texttt{xtime}$$.

$$
\begin{align}
\texttt{04} \cdot \mathbf{a} &= x \cdot x \cdot a(x) &&= \texttt{xtime}(\texttt{xtime}(\mathbf{a})) \\
\texttt{08} \cdot \mathbf{a} &= x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot a(x) &&= \texttt{xtime}(\texttt{xtime}(\texttt{xtime}(\mathbf{a})))
\end{align}
$$

For other multiplications, we decompose them into multiplications of powers of $$x$$. In the MixColumns, there is another multiplication, $$\texttt{03}\cdot \mathbf{a}$$.

$$
\texttt{03}\cdot \mathbf{a} = (x + 1) \cdot \mathbf{a} = \texttt{xtime}(\mathbf{a}) \cdot \mathbf{a}
$$

In the inverse MixColumns, there are 3 other multiplications:

- Multiply by $$\texttt{09}$$:

$$
    \texttt{09}\cdot \mathbf{a} = (x^3 + 1) \cdot \mathbf{a} = \texttt{xtime}(\texttt{xtime}(\texttt{xtime}(\mathbf{a}))) \cdot \mathbf{a} \\
$$

- Multiply by $$\texttt{11}$$:

$$
    \texttt{11}\cdot \mathbf{a} = (x^3 + x + 1) \cdot \mathbf{a} = \texttt{xtime}(\texttt{xtime}(\texttt{xtime}(\mathbf{a}))) \cdot \texttt{xtime}(\mathbf{a}) \cdot \mathbf{a} \\
$$

- Multiply by $$\texttt{13}$$:

$$
    \texttt{13}\cdot \mathbf{a} = (x^3 + x^2 + 1) \cdot \mathbf{a} = \texttt{xtime}(\texttt{xtime}(\texttt{xtime}(\mathbf{a}))) \cdot \texttt{xtime}(\texttt{xtime}(\mathbf{a})) \cdot \mathbf{a} \\
$$

- Multiply by $$\texttt{14}$$:

$$
    \texttt{14}\cdot \mathbf{a} = (x^3 + x^2 + x) \cdot \mathbf{a} = \texttt{xtime}(\texttt{xtime}(\texttt{xtime}(\mathbf{a}))) \cdot \texttt{xtime}(\texttt{xtime}(\mathbf{a})) \cdot \texttt{xtime}(\mathbf{a})\\
$$

For implementation, we can reuse the computations in order to avoid recomputing the same thing multiple times. For example, $$\texttt{14}\cdot \mathbf{a}$$,

```Python
def mul14(a):
    u = xtime(a)
    v = xtime(u)
    t = xtime(v)
    return u ^ v ^ t
```

That's it! Enjoy coding!
